  <p>
    I'm a Master's student at Stony Brook University, New York where I'm working in the <a href="http://lunr.cs.stonybrook.edu">Language Understanding and Reasoning Lab</a>.
    My current research is focused on Complex Reasoning using Large Language Models. I have also worked on commonsense reasoning in Question-Answering and multimodal knowledge-distillation. <br>
    Prior to this, I was working as a Backend Engineer for 2 years after graduating from BITS Pilani in 2019. <br>
    Right now I am actively looking for full-time opportunities in ML and Software Engineering starting. If you have any relevant positions, please feel free to reach out to me. <br>
    You can read more about my work in my <a href="/about">CV.</a>
