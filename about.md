## Experience

### Language Understanding and Reasoning Lab, Stony Brook University
*Student Reseacher (Aug 2021 - Present)* <br>
- __Complex reasoning__: Studying complex reasoning and generalization of compositional tasks in Natural Language Processing by prompting LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. 
- __Commonsense reasoning for answering why-questions__: different aspects of incorporating external knowledge, including how to extract the most relevant information, how much knowledge to inject and in what form, and when to add it. Contributed towards building the model for extracting the most relevant relations. 
- __Cross-modal knowledge distillation__: Developed a cross-modal distillation strategy to improve over the performance of vision-only models for action anticipation.

### NetApp Inc., US
*Software Engineering Intern - StorageGRID (May 2022 - Dec 2022)* <br>
- Supported metric conversion into different units for storage related metrics and white-labeling in the
StorageGRID management tool using Angular.
- This was a part of the interface overhaul to provide improved customer experience.

### Swiggy, India
*Software Engineer II - Revenue and Growth (Jul 2019 - Aug 2021)* <br>
- Worked on multiple Go, Java, and Python backend microservices based on REST, gRPC framework with AWS
cloud infrastructure.
- Integrated AWS localstack cloud library in the local testing pipeline to reduce developer effort by 3 hours per
feature deployment, and improve functional and unit test coverage by 35%.
- Added middleware for error handling, system recovery and logging metrics to monitor services.
- Led the design and deployment of several features on the discounting platform, including rate-limiting, tiered
loyalty program (Swiggy Super) and a ranking system to show relevant offers based on consumer behavior
patterns.
- Worked on Named Entity Recognition for food items in code-mixed chat data using Deep learning, under the
Applied Research team.

### Morgan Stanley., India
*Technical Analyst Intern - Wealth Management (Jan 2019 - Jun 2019)* <br>
- Implemented the server-side API for W3C’s Web Authentication specification for public key cryptography based
secure-key authenticators using C#.
- Integrated secure-key authentication with the existing multi-factor authentication system.

### Microsoft, India
*Software Engineering Intern - Office 365 (May 2018 - Jul 2018)* <br>
- Created an on-boarding tool to migrate Data Loss Prevention Policies from compete platforms to Office 365 DLP
using C# and XSLT.

## Projects and Open Source Contributions
- __Complex reasoning in NLP__ - Studying compositional generalization of NLP tasks by prompting LLMs in zero-shot
and few-shot settings as part of MS thesis in Language Understanding and Reasoning Lab.

- __Approximate Pattern Matching using Seed-and-extend heuristic__ - Designed and implemented an optimized
dynamic programming algorithm for approximate pattern matching in text strings using Python.

- __DNS resolver with added support for DNSSEC__ - Created a command line tool for a recursive DNS resolver to
querry different record types with support for DNSSEC protocol, using dnspython library.

- __Mininet__ - Implemented static routes and dynamic routing (RIP) on a network topology configured using Mininet
with AWS EC2.

- __Picolo: A Smart Assistant__ - Designed a system to improve the user interaction experience in online meetings that
leverages OCR to extract text from images in real time. Implemented and evaluated a web-browser extension
and desktop application interface.
